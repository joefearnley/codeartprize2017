# Bravo LT - Code-Art Prize 2017
The *Bravo Code-Art Prize 2017* is a contest with an emphasis on functional code that is, also, beautiful.

## Summary

Credit for the problem you will be solving goes to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17). 

>If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.
>
>If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?
>
>
>NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.
